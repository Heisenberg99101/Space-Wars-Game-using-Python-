# Space-Wars-Game-using-Python-
I created a multiplayer game using Python called Space Wars.
This is a multiplayer space game. This was the first game i made using python from pygame.  
This helped me go through the basics of Pygame and its modules. Also Understanding the basics of creating a simple 2D game using Pygame.
This game included understanding the logic of shooting and positioning of bullets, and how they would leave the spaceship while the spaceship itself is moving
in its own area. It also included the logic of positioning of spaceships and how every time the bullet hits the either of the spaceship, their number of lives reduces.
This was very enjoyable for me to make and learn!!!
Hoping to make some more exciting projects!!
